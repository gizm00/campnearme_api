		<h4>Greetings Toorcampers!</h4>
		I'm delighted to be hosting the first campnear.me API hackathon at Toorcamp! Hacking on campgrounds while camping, I cant think of a better situation to launch the campnear.me API<br>
		<br>
		I'm excited to see what people make with the data, and wanted to provide some APIs that play nicely with campground data.
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://developer.forecast.io/" target=_blank>Forecast.io</a> I use Forecast.io on <a href="http://campnear.me" target=_blank>campnear.me</a> to provide forecast info for trip planning. They have a great <a href="http://blog.forecast.io/forecast-embeds/" target=_blank>drop in widget</a> that you can just plop into your website with the corresponding lat/longs.</li>
			<br>
			<li><a href="http://developer.opensignal.com/" target=_blank>OpenSignal API</a> Find out if you can tether and work from camp, or just see if you will have cell service at the campground, or search for specifically off the grid campgrounds :) </li>
			<br>
			<li><a href="http://inciweb.nwcg.gov/state/38/" target=_blank>Inciweb, OR</a> An RSS feed is available, provides latest information on forest fires. Definitely something I wish I'd had access to last summer camping near Lake Chelan!</li>
			<br>
			<li><a href="http://www.cleardarksky.com/c/Blackfootkey.html?1" target=_blank> ClearDarkSky</a> For star gazers and astrophotogs, check out these forecast maps you can embed in your website, so long as you arent charging for access to it</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		The campnear.me API is extremely new, should you encounter issues please let me know on the <a href="https://github.com/gizm00/campnearme_api" target =_blank>GitHub page</a>
		<br>
		<br>
		New to data hacking? You can get a setup and some instructions from my <a href="https://github.com/gizm00/pycon2016" target=_blank>tutorial on data pipelining in Python</a><br>
		<a href="https://github.com/gizm00/pycon2016/blob/master/notebooks/Lab%201%20-%20RIDB%20API.ipynb" target=_blank>Lab 1</a> should get you setup to get connected to an API endpoint and read the json response into a table-based object called a DataFrame. To learn more about python dataframes I recommend <a href="https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/jvns/PyData%20NYC%202013%20tutorial" target=_blank>this tutorial from Julia Evans.</a> You can run it right in the browser!
		<br>
		<br>
		Since we will be camping, and this API is newly minted, I will have some USB sticks with a dump of the database should folks run into trouble accessing the API
		<br>
		<br>
		If you build something and want to share, please consider using the <a href="https://github.com/toorcampnearme" target=_blank>toorcampnearme</a> GitHub org! It would be swell to catalog what people make. Ping me with your GitHub handle to get added to the org.
