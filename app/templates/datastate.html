		This API provides access to the backend database for <a href="http://campnear.me" target=_blank>campnear.me</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Includes 3,000+ campgrounds in Oregon and Washington</li>
			<li>Consolidation of info from Federal, state and local agencies</li>
			<li>Reservation availability for the upcoming weekend</li>
			<li>Facility URLs from a variety of sources pertaining to each facility</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		Some things to keep in mind:
		<ul>
			<li>Latitude/Longitude coordinates for the campgrounds are mostly not verified. Lost Lake campground is, for example, not actually in the middle of a lake as the Lat/Long would have you believe</li>
			<li>There are duplicates in the dataset</li>
			<li>There are URLs that end in 404s in the dataset</li>
			<li>There will be times when this data will be wrong. If you discover such a case please let me know by <a href="https://github.com/gizm00/campnearme_api/issues">filing an issue!</a></li>
			<li>This data is large. Each record has 101 fields</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		The intent of this dataset is to consolidate available sources of campground information to give campers a better springboard for trip planning. It is certainly necessary to take information with a grain of salt and call the local ranger station before heading into an unfamiliar part of the woods
